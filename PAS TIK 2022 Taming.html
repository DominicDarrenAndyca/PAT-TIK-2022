    <h3>
    <li>Leveling up taming will grant Pet Luck</li>
    <li>Taming 50 will give you 50 Pet Luck</li>
    <li>Best way to grind for taming xp is to have a Booster Cookie, a skill boost pet item on your pet, and using a mythic enderman or a legendary tarantula pet</li>
    <li>However, this skill levels up by itself. So you don't need to actively grind for taming xp</li>
