    <h3>Fishing is one of the core player Skills players can level up as they earn Fishing XP. The max Fishing level obtainable is 50.</h3>
    <h1><u>Treasure Hunter</u></h1>
    <h3>Treasure Hunter is the skill's ability which is exclusively upgraded by increasing your Fishing Skill level. For every level of Treasure Hunter you gain an additional +0.2% Treasure Catch chance. If you were Fishing level 25, you would gain +5% chance to catch treasure.</h3>
    
  <h1><u>Fishing Xp Gain</u></h1>
  <h3>You get Fishing XP from catching treasure, or killing Sea Creatures that you catch. Killing Sea Creatures that other people fish up does not reward you with Fishing XP. If someone kills your Sea Creature, you get the Fishing XP.</h3>
  <h3>The chance of catching Sea Creatures is dependent on your Sea Creature Chance. Some Armor and Fishing rods give Sea Creature Chance as a base stat. There are Baits that also increases your Sea Creature Chance.</h3>
  <h3>The amount of Fishing XP you get from treasure and mobs differ, and stronger mobs or rarer treasures give more.</h3>
